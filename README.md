# 📚 LibMaSy – Library Management System

LibMaSy is a full-stack Library Management System built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF).  
It is designed to efficiently manage books, users, and administrative operations with secure authentication and structured data handling.

This project marks my first deployed full-stack web application, focusing on backend development, REST APIs, and cloud deployment.
